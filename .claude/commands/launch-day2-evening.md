description: Launch all Day 2 evening agents (16-17) in parallel
---

I need you to launch 2 agents in parallel for Day 2 evening. Each agent should read their task file and work completely autonomously.

Launch both agents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool in a SINGLE message:

Agent 16: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_02/AGENT_16_lossless_validation.md

Agent 17: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_02/AGENT_17_phase0_docs.md

IMPORTANT:
- Use ONE message with 2 Task tool calls
- Each agent must work autonomously
- Each agent must complete ALL testing requirements
- Each agent must mark all success criteria before reporting completion
