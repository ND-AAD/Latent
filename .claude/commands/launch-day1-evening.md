description: Launch all Day 1 evening agents (7-9) in parallel
---

I need you to launch 3 agents in parallel for Day 1 evening. Each agent should read their task file and work completely autonomously.

Launch all 3 agents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool in a SINGLE message:

Agent 7: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_07_tessellation.md

Agent 8: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_08_desktop_bridge.md

Agent 9: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_09_basic_tests.md

IMPORTANT:
- Use ONE message with 3 Task tool calls
- Each agent must work autonomously
- Each agent must complete ALL testing requirements
- Each agent must mark all success criteria before reporting completion
