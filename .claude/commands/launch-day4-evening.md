description: Launch Day 4 evening agents (32-33) - First mathematical lens!
---

Launch 2 agents IN PARALLEL for Day 4 evening - First working mathematical lens:

Agent 32: docs/reference/api_sprint/DAYS_4_10_AGENT_SUMMARY.md (Differential Decomposition - FIRST LENS!)
Agent 33: docs/reference/api_sprint/DAYS_4_10_AGENT_SUMMARY.md (Iteration System)

**Agent 32 is critical** - implements the FIRST mathematical lens (differential/curvature-based region discovery). This validates the entire analysis architecture!
