description: Launch all Day 1 morning agents (1-6) in parallel
---

I need you to launch 6 agents in parallel for Day 1 morning. Each agent should read their task file and work completely autonomously.

Launch all 6 agents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool in a SINGLE message:

Agent 1: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_01_types_data_structures.md

Agent 2: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_02_subd_evaluator_header.md

Agent 3: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_03_cmakelists.md

Agent 4: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_04_subd_evaluator_impl.md

Agent 5: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_05_pybind11_bindings.md

Agent 6: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_01/AGENT_06_grasshopper_server.md

IMPORTANT:
- Use ONE message with 6 Task tool calls
- Each agent must work autonomously
- Each agent must complete ALL testing requirements
- Each agent must mark all success criteria before reporting completion
