description: Launch all Day 3 agents (18-25) in parallel
---

I need you to launch 8 agents in parallel for Day 3. Each agent should read their task file and work completely autonomously.

Launch all 8 agents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool in a SINGLE message:

Agent 18: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_03/AGENT_18_edit_mode_manager.md

Agent 19: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_03/AGENT_19_face_picker.md

Agent 20: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_03/AGENT_20_edge_picker.md

Agent 21: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_03/AGENT_21_vertex_picker.md

Agent 22: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_03/AGENT_22_edit_mode_toolbar.md

Agent 23: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_03/AGENT_23_parametric_region.md

Agent 24: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_03/AGENT_24_region_list_ui.md

Agent 25: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_03/AGENT_25_region_visualization.md

IMPORTANT:
- Use ONE message with 8 Task tool calls
- Each agent must work autonomously
- Each agent must complete ALL testing requirements
- Each agent must mark all success criteria before reporting completion
- Use cpp_core (not latent_core) for Python module imports
