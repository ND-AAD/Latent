description: Launch all Day 2 morning agents (10-15) in parallel
---

I need you to launch 6 agents in parallel for Day 2 morning. Each agent should read their task file and work completely autonomously.

Launch all 6 agents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool in a SINGLE message:

Agent 10: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_02/AGENT_10_limit_surface_evaluation.md

Agent 11: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_02/AGENT_11_vtk_viewport_base.md

Agent 12: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_02/AGENT_12_vtk_subd_display.md

Agent 13: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_02/AGENT_13_multi_viewport_layout.md

Agent 14: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_02/AGENT_14_application_state.md

Agent 15: Read and complete task in docs/reference/api_sprint/agent_tasks/day_02/AGENT_15_main_window.md

IMPORTANT:
- Use ONE message with 6 Task tool calls
- Each agent must work autonomously
- Each agent must complete ALL testing requirements
- Each agent must mark all success criteria before reporting completion
